# Early Parkinsons' disease detection Using Spiral Dataset.
**Overview**
A long-term degenerative condition called Parkinson's disease (PD) affects a person's neural system and motor memory. There is no reliable and efficient treatment. However, the spiral test and speech smearing can be used to detect Parkinson's disease in the early stage.
This proposed work is an attempt to build Parkinson’s Disease detection systems using a spiral dataset. The spiral test is one of the most fundamental techniques used. Individuals are asked to draw spirals, which are then pre-processed and fed to a machine-learning algorithms. These classifiers are used to categorize the spirals into two classes - ‘Healthy’ and ‘Parkinson’s’. Also, evaluation and comparison of performance measures such as accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity for all the classifiers used is done.

**Data Source**
Dataset collected from kaggle’s repository, carried out at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. Having 102 total images.

**Features**
-Data Collection: Gather relevant patient data, including demographic information, medical history, motor symptoms, and other clinical assessments.
Feature Engineering: Extract and preprocess features from the raw data, such as tremor amplitude, gait speed, voice characteristics, and other biomarkers associated with PD.
-Model Development: Train machine learning models, such as logistic regression, random forest, or support vector machines, to predict the likelihood of Parkinson's disease based on the extracted features.
-Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the predictive model using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC).
-Interpretation and Validation: Interpret the model results and validate its effectiveness in detecting early signs of Parkinson's disease using independent test datasets or cross-validation techniques.
