# Early Parkinsons disease detection
A long-term degenerative condition called Parkinson's disease (PD) affects a person's neural system and motor memory. There is no reliable and efficient treatment. However, the spiral test and speech smearing can be used to detect Parkinson's disease in the early stage.
This proposed work is an attempt to build Parkinson’s Disease detection systems using a spiral dataset. The spiral test is one of the most fundamental techniques used. Individuals are asked to draw spirals, which are then pre-processed and fed to a machine-learning algorithms. These classifiers are used to categorise the spirals into two classes - ‘Healthy’ and ‘Parkinson’s’. Also, evaluation and comparison of performance measures such as accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity for all the classifiers used is done.
